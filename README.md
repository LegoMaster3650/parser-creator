parser-creator
==============
```sh
npm install parser-creator --save
```
Say you want to make your own node.js based programming language, but creating a parser from scratch seems like too much work? This project is the solution! By creating a few files, writing some lines of code, and setting some basic things up, you can create your own language. Wanna base it inside of node? No problem! Add a custom file extension? Got that too! Support for uploading as a package to npm? Sure, that's fine with me AND supported! This powerful and free tool has many capabilities I think you'll find nice.
